let a = {};
# Options:
#    1. assign only *new* properties into an object with let?
# or 2. allow overriding existing properties with let?
# With variables, we allow shadowing, which is pretty much overriding, and it would be weird to not allow the same syntax for objects.

let a.{ c, d } = { c: 6, d: 7 };
[a.b, a.c, a.d] == [5, 6, 7]
